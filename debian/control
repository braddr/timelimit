Description: simple utility to limit a process's absolute execution time
 The timelimit utility executes a command and terminates the spawned process
 after a given time with a given signal.  A "warning" signal is sent first,
 then, after a timeout, a "kill" signal, similar to the way init(8) operates
 on shutdown.
