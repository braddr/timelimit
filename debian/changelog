timelimit (1.8-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.9.8:
    - update the copyright file to copyright format 1.0
    - fix the copyright file information about upstream version 1.8
    - drop the DM-Upload-Allowed source control field
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility level to 9:
    - get the build flags (incl. hardening) directly from debhelper
    - drop the hardening-includes build dependency
    - drop the versioned dpkg-dev build dependency for dpkg-buildflags
  * Drop the source compression options; dpkg-dev's defaults are good enough.
  * Let uscan verify upstream's signature against my own key.
  * Update the copyright file a bit:
    - bump the year on my debian/* copyright notice
    - rename the "BSD-2" license to "BSD-2-clause"
  * Add the debian/upstream/metadata file.
  * Add --parallel to the debhelper invocation.
  * Add Multi-Arch: foreign to the binary package.
  * Point the Vcs-* source control fields and the upstream metadata
    Repository fields to the new GitLab full-source repository and
    use the HTTPS scheme.

timelimit (1.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * After a discussion with George Danchev <danchev@debian.org> and
    Mats Erik Andersson (the maintainer of netpipes), make the binary
    package conflict versioned - the next upload of netpipes will not
    install a timelimit binary, so the conflict will be resolved.
    Thanks a lot to George Danchev and Mats Erik Andersson for
    the discussion and assistance!
  * Add a override for the "conflicts with version" Lintian informational
    message that the above change provokes.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 with no changes.
