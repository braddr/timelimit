.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
The following examples are shown as given to the shell:
.Pp
.Dl timelimit /usr/local/bin/rsync rsync://some.host/dir /opt/mirror
.Pp
Run the rsync program to mirror a WWW or FTP site and kill it if it
runs longer than 1 hour (that is 3600 seconds) with SIGTERM.
If the rsync process does not exit after receiving the SIGTERM,
.Nm
issues a SIGKILL 120 seconds after the SIGTERM.
.Pp
.Dl tcpserver 0 8888 timelimit -t600 -T300 /opt/services/chat/stats
.Pp
Start a
.Xr tcpserver n
process listening on tcp port 8888; each client connection shall invoke
an instance of an IRC statistics tool under
.Pa /opt/services/chat
and kill it after 600 seconds have elapsed.
If the stats process is still running after the SIGTERM, it will be
killed by a SIGKILL sent 300 seconds later.
.Pp
.Dl env WARNTIME=600 WARNSIG=1 KILLTIME=30 timelimit sh stats.sh
.Pp
Start a shell script and kill it with a SIGHUP in 600 seconds.
If the shell gets stuck and does not respond to the SIGHUP, kill it
with the default SIGKILL after 30 more seconds.
