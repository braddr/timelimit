.Op Fl t Ar warntime
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes a given

with the supplied
.Ar arguments
and terminates the spawned process after a given time with a given signal.
If the process exits before the time limit has elapsed,
.Nm
will silently exit, too.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
Quiet operation -
.Nm
does not output diagnostic messages about signals sent to the child process.
.It Fl S Ar killsig
Specify the number of the signal to be sent to the process
.Ar killtime
seconds after
.Ar warntime
has expired.
Defaults to 9 (SIGKILL).
.It Fl s Ar warnsig
Specify the number of the signal to be sent to the process
.Ar warntime
seconds after it has been started.
Defaults to 15 (SIGTERM).
.It Fl T Ar killtime
Specify the maximum execution time of the process before sending
.Ar killsig
after
.Ar warnsig
has been sent.
Defaults to 120 seconds.
.It Fl t Ar warntime
Specify the maximum execution time of the process in seconds before sending
.Ar warnsig .
Defaults to 3600 seconds.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
The following examples are shown as given to the shell:
.Pp
.Dl timelimit /usr/local/bin/rsync rsync://some.host/dir /opt/mirror
.Pp
Run the rsync program to mirror a WWW or FTP site and kill it if it
runs longer than 1 hour (that is 3600 seconds) with SIGTERM.
If the rsync process does not exit after receiving the SIGTERM,
.Nm
issues a SIGKILL 120 seconds after the SIGTERM.
.Pp
.Dl tcpserver 0 8888 timelimit -t600 -T300 /opt/services/chat/stats
.Pp
Start a
.Xr tcpserver n
process listening on tcp port 8888; each client connection shall invoke
an instance of an IRC statistics tool under
.Pa /opt/services/chat
and kill it after 600 seconds have elapsed.
If the stats process is still running after the SIGTERM, it will be
killed by a SIGKILL sent 300 seconds later.
.Pp
.Dl env WARNTIME=600 WARNSIG=1 KILLTIME=30 timelimit sh stats.sh
.Pp
Start a shell script and kill it with a SIGHUP in 600 seconds.
If the shell gets stuck and does not respond to the SIGHUP, kill it
with the default SIGKILL after 30 more seconds.
